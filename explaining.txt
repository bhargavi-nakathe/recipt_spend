GITIGNORE
# Python: This is a comment.
 It's just a label to make the file easier to read.
 It means "the following rules are for files related to the Python programming language."

__pycache__/: When you run a Python program, it creates a folder called __pycache__ to store temporary, pre-processed versions of your code to make it run faster next time.
 This folder is automatically created and should be ignored.

*.py[cod]: The asterisk * is a wildcard, meaning "any file name."
 This line tells Git to ignore any file ending in .pyc, .pyo, or .pyd.
 These are temporary compiled versions of Python code.

*$py.class: Similar to above, this ignores a specific type of temporary file.

*.so: Ignores "shared object" files, which are compiled code libraries (common in languages like C that are used with Python).

The rest of the lines (build/, dist/, *.egg, etc.):
 These are all folders and files that are created when you are packaging or distributing your Python code.
 They are like the "shipping boxes" for your software—you don't need to store the boxes in your workshop, because you can always build new ones when you need to ship something.

SRC
cv2 (OpenCV): For working with images (like editing photos)
pytesseract: For reading text from images (OCR - Optical Character Recognition)
re: For finding patterns in text (like finding prices)
numpy: For working with numbers and arrays
PIL: For handling images
Config: A separate file containing settings
try: starts error handling
cv2.imread(image_path) loads the image from file path
if img is None: checks if image loaded properly
gray = ... converts color image to black & white
denoised = ... removes noise (like removing grain from photo)
thresh = ... makes image purely black and white (no gray) for better text reading
custom_config tells the text reader how to process the image
pytesseract.image_to_string() converts image text to actual text
items = [] creates empty list to store found items
lines = text.split('\n') breaks text into separate lines
re.search() looks for price patterns in each line
If found, float() converts text price to number (like "10.99" to 10.99)
re.sub(pattern, '', line) removes price from line, leaving item name
joblib: For saving/loading trained models
classifier: The actual AI that learns categories
is_trained: Tracks if model is trained
